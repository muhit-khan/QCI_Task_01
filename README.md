Sure, here is the previous message with Markdown formatting:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command. For example, if your project is located at `/QCI_Task_01`

3. Create a virtual environment by running the following command:

   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment. The command to activate the virtual environment depends on your operating system:

   - For Windows:
     ```shell
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```shell
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Once the virtual environment is activated, you should see `(venv)` in your command prompt.

6. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file by running the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. After the dependencies are installed, you can run the `main.py` file using the following command:
   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

Make sure you have Python installed on your system before following these steps.
